A repo of my MSc university final project

In this repo you will see all of the files I used to build my masters project over a three month duration with Queens Univerity Belfast. It was a learning curve,
but something I'm very proud that I achieved. I'm sure there are plenty of things that I can improve on and that's the plan as I develop my skills as an engineer.
